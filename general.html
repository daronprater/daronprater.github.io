                <p>Proper dental hygiene, including regular professional cleanings, are the key to a healthy, happy smile. A hygiene appointment is more than cleaning your teeth – it’s an oral wellness exam.
                    
                    What can you expect at your hygiene exam?
                    
                    <ul>
                        <li>Oral cancer screening</li>
                        <li>Periodontal risk assessment</li>
                        <li>Full dental charting</li>
                        <li>Full dental cleaning and polishing</li>
                        <li>Oral hygiene instructions</li>
                        <li>Oral product recommendations</li>
                    </ul>                   
                    This in-depth exam allows us to see the whole picture – not just your teeth. Why? Your oral health is directly connected to overall health. Oral disease such as periodontal disease can have devastating effects on your body, increasing your chance of heart disease, diabetes, and much more.

                <p>A dental crown is a tooth-shaped shell that fits over the entire tooth, covering and protecting it.
                    Each crown is made individually to blend in beautifully with your other teeth.
                    At Kenwood Advanced Dentistry we offer:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Porcelain Ceramic Crowns</li>

                    </ul>
                
                    <p>Not only are they strong and durable but blend in with the natural look of your other teeth perfectly.
                       We use crowns to treat a range of common concerns including:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Building up a tooth that has been damaged by grinding</li>
                      <li>Concealing a tooth that is badly stained or oddly shaped</li>
                      <li>Protecting a tooth weakened by root canal therapy</li>
                      <li>Repairing a tooth that is cracked or broken</li>
                      <li>Restoring a tooth that has been damaged by decay</li>
                      <li>Replacing a missing tooth as part of a dental implant</li>
                    </ul>
                
                  <p>Dental bridges use a combination of crowns and artificial teeth to replace one or more missing teeth.
                  Crowns affixed to the adjacent teeth (or dental implants) hold replacement teeth (known as pontics) in the spaces left by the missing teeth.
                  The replacement teeth complete your smile and restore functionality so that you can chew foods with ease and smile with confidence!</p>

                    With professional teeth whitening, you can remove those pesky stains caused by coffee, tea and other products that leave your teeth stained.
                    </p>
                    <p>In your consultation, Dr. Prater will assess the overall health of your teeth and gums to confirm you are a good overall candidate for tooth whitening.
                        Dr. Prater will then create a mold of your teeth which will be used create a set of thin trays to use and apply the tooth whitening material.
                        After approximately a month of tray use, a follow up consultation will occur with Dr. Prater to finalize your treatment.</p>

                <p>Inalys and Onlays are used to protect teeth that have been significantly impacted by decay.
                    Inlays and Onlays provide a stronger and longer lasting option when compared to fillings, while providing a more conservative restorative option when compared to crowns.
                    At Kenwood Advanced Dentistry we use porcelain inlays and onlays to help brighten our patients smiles.
                </p>
                <p>When tooth decay has impacted one of your teeth to the point where a filling is not enough, dental inlays and onlays provide a conservative treatment option compared to crowns.
                    Dental inlays, which are similar to fillings, fill the spaces between the cusps at the center of the tooth's surface.
                    Dental onlays work like inlays but cover one or more cusps of the entire biting surface.
                </p>
                <p>Inlays and onlays are bonded directly to your tooth, which provides much more strength and protection when compared to a composite filling.
                    Due to their strength and ability to match the color of your teeth, porcelain inlays and onlays will provide you peace of mind about
                    your smile and oral health.
                </p>
                <p>If you've decided to go with the inlay/onlay as a treatment option,
                    you can expect to have the following procedures performed.
                  </p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Removal of decay around tooth that will receive inlay/onlay</li>
                      <li>Dr. Prater will take an impression of your tooth to have a model of your tooth made for the creation of the inlay/onlay.</li>
                      <li>A temporary filling will be attached to your tooth for protection until your inlay/onlay is ready.</li>
                      <li>At your second visit, the inlay/onlay will be permanately bonded to your tooth.</li>

                <p>Porcelain veneers are thin shells of ceramic that bond directly to the front and top surfaces of your teeth.
                    When bonded to your teeth, porcelain veneers blend in beautifully with your natural smile and are highly resistant to tea and coffee stains.
                </p>
                <h3>Advantages of Porcelain Veneers</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Improved smile and appearance. Porcelain veeners are well suited for anyone with broken, discolored or misshapen teeth.
                        The porcelain material bonds to your teeth which results in a natural beautiful smile.</li>
                    <li>Less invasive than crowns. The prodecure for porcelain veneer placement is much less invasive than that of crown placemenet and results in a stronger bond than traiditonal crowns.</li>
                    <li>Stain Resistant. Veneers tend to me more stain resistant to things like coffee and tea than traditional crowns.</li>

                <h3>Botox</h3>
                <p>Botox is a simple, non-surgical, physician-administered treatment that can temporarily smooth moderate to severe frown lines between the brows.
                    All it takes is one 10-minute treatment and within days there's a noticeable improvement which can last up to 4 months.
                    Botox is a purified protein produced by the Clostridium botulinum bacterium, which reduces the activity of the muscles that cuase frown lines between the brows to form over time.</p>
            
                <p>Dr. Prater will determine where to administer the injections by examining you ability to move certain muscles in the brow area.
                Then, Dr. Prater will administer several tiny injections of Botox directly into the muscles that cause lines between the brows.
                In addition to the frown lines, Botox is also used for the crow's feet and forehead lines.
                <h3>Dermal Fillers (Juvederm)</h3>
                <p>Juvederm is a gel made of hyaluronic acid, a natural occuring substance in your skin.
                Hyaluronic acid plays a vital role in hydrating your skin and producing volume.
                Juvederm is injected under the skin to instantly restore your skin's volume and smooth away facial wrinkles and folds.
                Since hyaluronic acid is a natural substance in your body, no allergy tests are needed prior to receiving an injection of Juvederm.
                Hyaluronic acid dermal fillers like Juvederm injectable gel offer a safe and effective non-surgical option for smoothing facial wrinkles and folds.</p>
                <p>Juvederm is available in two formulations: Juvederm Ultra for versatility in contouring and volumizing facial
                wrinkles and folds, and Juvederm Ultra Plus, a more robust formulation for volumizing and correcting depper folds and wrinkles.

                <p>TMJ, more formally known as "Temporomandibular Joint Disorder" occurs when the joint connecting the skull and jaw begins to malfunction.
                    Often symptoms include pain at the join, migrane headaches, clicking and popping jaw as well as others.
                    At Kenwood Advanced Dentistry, we offer services to help minimize the pain caused by this painful condition.
                    A decision on how to treat your TMJ symptoms will depend on the origination and intensity of the symptoms.
                    Depending on those, Dr. Prater might recommend the following:</p>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Prescription pain medication</li>
                      <li>Physical Therapy</li>
