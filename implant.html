    <p>A dental implant is an artifical tooth root that provides the foundation for fixed or replacement teeth.
        When compared to other options like crowns, bridges, and dentures, dental implants are the ideal tooth option because they replace the crown and root of the tooth.
    
    </p>
    <p>Dental implants are the ideal tooth replacement option because they provide a stronger foundation than other replacement options.
        Once the implant is inserted, the bone tissue will grow around the implant providing your implant structural support.
        This support will assist in not damaging adjacent teeth by relying on them for support and will look and feel like your natural tooth.
    </p>
    <p>The process of placing a dental implant includes:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Tooth extraction and Bone Grafting</li>
        <li>Dental Implant Placement</li>
        <li>Abutment & Artifical Tooth Placement</li>

                <h3>Tooth Extraction</h3>
                <p>The first step in placing a dental implant is to remove the tooth where the implant will be placed.
                    During this process Dr. Prater will extract the tooth leaving an opening inside of the bone that once supported it. 
                    While the tissues around the extraction site heal, the remaining bone won't fill in the open area.
                    As a result, the quality of bone that’s left to support adjacent teeth is worsened.
                    To ensure there’s adequate bone in the open socket to support your new implant restoration and the neighboring teeth, a post tooth extraction bone graft will be necessary. </p>
                 <h3>Bone Grafting</h3>
                 <p>Bone grafting is the process of creating new healthy bone in the open area left from the extraction site to provide a solid foundation for your new implant restoration and support the neighboring teeth.
                    This is done directly after the extraction process.
                    Once the bone grafting is complete, the extraction site is closed up where the bone graft will "take" and create new healthy bone in the site.
                    Once the new healthy bone is dense enough you will be able to move forward with implant placement
                 </p>

                    <h3>Placing the Implant</h3>
                    Dr. Prater will first make an incision to your gum and expose the bone where the implant will be placed.
                    Once the site is exposed a hole will be drilled to allow for the implant to be placed.
                    Since the implant will serve as the root of the tooth, the implant is then placed deep into the bone.
                    Once the implant is placed Dr. Prater will close the incision and the healing process will begin.
                    Your new implant will need time integrate into your current bone structure and can take several months to complete.

                    <h3>Placing the Implant Crown</h3>
                    The last step will be placing your artifical crown to the newly placed implant.
                    Impressions will be taken of your teeth which will be used to create your new implant crown.
                    Once your gums have healed and the implant has fully "taken" Dr. Prater will place the new implant crown.
                </p>

                    You may experience some discomfort following any of the procedures described above.
                    After each phase Dr. Prater will provide you with post operative instructions which will include:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Any medications you should take</li>
                        <li>Best practices for keeping the site healthy</li>
                        <li>What you should and should not eat after the procedure</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>If you have any questions after any phase of the implant process don't hesitate to call the office.</p>
